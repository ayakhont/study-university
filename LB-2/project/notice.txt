About VM:
==================================================================
Open session:
sudo openvpn --config LSB_YakhontovAlexander_lsb-gw.ovpn
ssh -i um89_id_rsa um89@m89.lsb.biocomp.unibo.it

Step 1: graphs
==================================================================
DsspStatistics.py run to get graphs

Step 2: obtaining blind set
==================================================================
1) Search Parameter:
Entries of :DepositDateQuery: pdbx_database_status.recvd_initial_deposition_date.comparator
    =between pdbx_database_status.recvd_initial_deposition_date.min=2015-01-01
    and Resolution is between 0.0 and 2.5
    and Percent Sequence Alignment Search : PDB can contain Expression Tag sequence = Yes ,
    and Sequence Length is between 50 and 300
    and Chain Type: there is a Protein chain but not any DNA or RNA or Hybrid
    and Experimental Method is X-RAY

As result 11852 entities

2) combine all fasta files in training set in one:
cat *.fasta >> training_data.fasta

3) To filter out PDB prooblems to run FilterOut.py -> rewriting blind_data.txt

4) To remove reduntency:
 - cluster al sequences with 30% identity:
    /home/urfin/programs/blast/blast-2.2.26/bin/blastclust -S 30 -i blind_data.txt -o clustered.txt -a 4 -L 0.0
