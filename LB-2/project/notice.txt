Step 1: graphs
==================================================================
DsspStatistics.py run to get graphs

Step 2: obtaining blind set
==================================================================
1) Search Parameter:
DepositDateQuery: pdbx_database_status.recvd_initial_deposition_date.comparator
=between pdbx_database_status.recvd_initial_deposition_date.min=2015-01-01
and Resolution is between 0.0
and 2.5 and Sequence Length is between 50
and 300 and Experimental Method is X-RAY
and Chain Type: there is a Protein chain but not any DNA or RNA or Hybrid
and Percent Sequence Alignment Search : PDB can contain Expression Tag sequence = Yes ,
and Representative Structures at 30% Sequence Identity

As result 3713 entities

2) combine all fasta files in training set in one:
cat *.fasta >> training_data.fasta

3) To filter out PDB prooblems to run FilterOut.py -> rewriting blind_data.txt

4) To remove reduntency:
 - cluster al sequences with 100% identity to remove absolutely similar seqs:
    /home/urfin/programs/blast/blast-2.2.26/bin/blastclust
        -S 100 -i blind_test_data.fasta -o clustered.txt
